# VotingApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.2.

In this app the users can submit a new link and after submitting the users will be able to
upvote or downvote each article. Each link will have a score and we can vote on
which links we find useful.
